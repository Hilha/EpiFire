# Abstract
Building networks from empirical data is complicated.  Flattening time-structured data is often done in order to make network problems tractable, since many methods do not consider time-dependent network structures.  Nodes and edges in a network, for example, are generally taken to exist contemporaneously in both analytical and simulation methods.  Discarding temporal information, however, can have a major effect on the conclusions that are drawn from the resulting network.

We present here a demonstration of the consequences of flattening time-structured data using various time intervals.  We also describe a way of simulating epidemics on time-structured networks.
